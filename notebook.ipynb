       "' Potato is a starchy vegetable that is grown underground in rows in a shallow, well-drained soil. It is a tuber, which means it is an underground, fleshy part of the plant that stores nutrients. Potatoes are a popular food source and are used in many different dishes, including salads, soups, stews, and baked dishes. They are also used as a source of starch for making paper and other products. Potatoes are high in carbohydrates and are a good source of fiber, vitamin C, and potassium.'"
